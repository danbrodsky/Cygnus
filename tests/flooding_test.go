/*
NOTE. When running this test you'll see errors about "reply type not a pointer"
This is because the "FindHostForClient" method doesn't fit the RPC guidelines.
In the future though, "FindHostForClient" will probably only be used internally and not exposed.
It's only like this now so we can test it

The test also won't pass 100% of the time because messages are being sent over UDP.
If any of the messages are lost, the test will fail. This is expected behaviour.
